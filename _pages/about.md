I am a Ph.D. student at the [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the supervision of [Prof. Tinghuan Chen](mailto:chentinghuan@cuhk.edu.cn). I received my B.Eng. degree in Microelectronics Science and Engineering from South China University of Technology in 2023.

My research focuses on the interdisciplinary area of **analog integrated circuit design automation** and **artificial intelligence**. I systematically apply deep learning, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and other AI techniques to tackle critical challenges in analog circuit design automation.

## Research Interests

My research spans circuit representation learning, graph matching and recognition, and layout design automation. Specific areas include:

- **Graph Neural Networks for Circuit Analysis**: Developing novel circuit representation learning methods that incorporate physical laws (e.g., Kirchhoff's Current Law) into neural network architectures
- **Reinforcement Learning for Layout Design**: Applying Monte Carlo Tree Search and other RL techniques to analog circuit placement optimization
- **Electrical Feature Encoding**: Creating efficient frequency-domain embeddings for circuit representations
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Integrating integer linear programming, branch-and-bound, and other optimization algorithms with circuit design automation

## News

- **2026**: One paper on circuit representation learning accepted by **AAAI 2026 (Oral)**
- **2026**: One paper accepted by **DATE 2026**
